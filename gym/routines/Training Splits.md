## How This Splits Guide Works With Your Gym Tracker

1. **Choose your split** from options above
2. **Create workout files** based on the split schedule

4. **Log exercises** following the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD ExerciseName.md`
5. **Track progress** using the Gym Dashboard views

## Switching Between Splits

It's okay to change your split! Many lifters rotate every 8-12 weeks.

### Why Switch?
- Break plateaus with new stimulus
- Adjust for life schedule changes
- Try different training styles
- Combat boredom

### Recommended Progression
1. **First 3 months**: Full Body 3x/week
2. **Months 3-6**: Upper/Lower 4x/week
3. **Months 6-12**: PPL or Upper/Lower 5x
4. **Year 2+**: Specialize based on weak points

## Tips for Success

1. **Consistency > perfection**: Stick with your split even if life gets busy
2. **Track your workouts**: Use the Gym Dashboard to identify patterns
3. **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase weight/reps/volume
4. **Recovery**: Sleep, nutrition, and stress management are essential
5. **Adjust as needed**: If a split isn't working, try another after 8 weeks minimum
