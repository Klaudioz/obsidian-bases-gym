## Progressive Overload for Legs

1. **Increase Load**: Add 5-10 lbs when completing all reps cleanly
2. **Increase Reps**: Progress from 5 → 6 → 8 reps before adding weight
3. **Increase Volume**: 5×5 → 5×6 or add another set
4. **Improve Depth**: Full ROM before increasing weight
5. **Reduce Rest**: Decrease recovery between sets by 15-30 seconds
