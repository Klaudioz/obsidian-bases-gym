## Progressive Overload Strategies

Track progress and gradually increase difficulty:

1. **Increase Weight**: Add 5-10 lbs when you hit target reps × sets
2. **Increase Reps**: Go from 4×6 → 4×8 before adding weight
3. **Add Volume**: Increase sets from 3 → 4 sets
4. **Decrease Rest**: Reduce rest periods by 15-30 seconds
5. **Improve Form**: Focus on ROM and control, then add load
